#The objective of this assignment is to set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Node.js application that is deployed on a serverless platform with Package Vulnerability Scan in placed!.

Instructions:

Create a new Node.js application using the Express framework.
Set up automatic testing for the application using a testing framework such as Jest or Mocha.
Create new branch on your existing repository.
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool such as Github Action, Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI.
Configure the pipeline to automatically build and test the code whenever changes are pushed to the code repository.
Deploy the application to a serverless platform such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
Store some information using Secret Management on AWS, then get the information as part of the pipeline.
Add Package Vulnerability Scan on your CICD
Configure the pipeline to automatically deploy the code to the serverless platform whenever changes are pushed to the code repository and all tests pass.
Write a documentation explaining the steps you have done, including the tools and services used.
Deliverables:

The Node.js application with automatic testing set up
Code repository with the CI/CD pipeline configured
Package Vulnerability Scan on your CICD in place
Documentation explaining the steps taken to set up the pipeline.
